/*
Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
For example, if there are three records in the table with CITY values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'.
The query returns 1, because total_number_of_records - number_of_unique_city_names = 3 - 2.

The STATION table is described as follows:
 ID: NUMBER
 CITY: VARCHAR2(21)
 STATE: VARCHAR2(2)
 LAT_N: NUMBER
 LONG_W: NUMBER
Where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT(CITY))
FROM STATION
